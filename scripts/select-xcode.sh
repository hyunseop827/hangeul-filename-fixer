# Selects the newest released Xcode 26.x on a GitHub macOS runner, where the versions are installed side by side as
# /Applications/Xcode_<version>.app, with `sudo xcode-select --switch`. scripts/toolchain.sh then uses that Xcode.
# Run by .github/workflows/ci.yml and release.yml. bash 3.2 compatible (the system bash on macOS).
#
# Only major version 26, on purpose. A newer major version must not be picked up just because a runner image gained it:
# - the app would be built with another SDK, which changes how macOS treats it (see scripts/build-app.sh);
# - ci.yml runs the tests as x86_64 under Rosetta, which needs a Swift toolchain that itself runs as x86_64.
#   Xcode 26 is universal; Xcode 27's compiler and SwiftPM are Apple Silicon only.
# Raising `major` below is a deliberate change, to be tried on a pull request first.
#
# Optional environment:
#   XCODE_SEARCH_ROOT  folder that holds the Xcode_<version>.app bundles (default /Applications); for trying the
#                      selection against a fake folder, with stub sudo, xcodebuild and swift first in PATH
